# Exercise 1
In this exercise you'll practice using git to clone and edit repositories, as will be required for later exercises.

1. If you haven't already, configure your name and email address for your GitHub account using the terminal.

2. If you haven't already create your own version of this repository on GitHub by using the link to using GitHub Classroom.

3. Using the terminal, clone **your version** of the repository to your machine (make sure you're in the desired directory on your terminal).

4. On your machine, open up this file (`exercise-1/README.md`) in a text editor of your choice.

5. In the `README.md` file, below these instructions, add an ordered list of what you ate for breakfast today.

6. Using your terminal, add and commit the changes you've made to your repository

7. Push changes up to GitHub, and view them in your web browser. Make sure you are looking at the repository under _your_ account!
